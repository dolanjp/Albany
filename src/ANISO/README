This folder used to contain the ANISO physics code
The ANISO package has been discontinued due to the lack
of resources to maintain it. You can retrieve it by
checking out the ANISO_support_end tag:

git checkout tags/ANISO_support_end

You can find information on the trilinos revision to use
in the tag comment. Simply do

git tag -v ANISO_support_end

to visualize information.
