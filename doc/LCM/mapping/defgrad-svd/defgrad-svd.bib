  abstract =     {This book is an introduction to the fundamental
                  concepts and tools needed for solving problems of a
                  geometric nature using a computer. It attempts to
                  fill the gap between standard geometry books, which
                  are primarily theoretical, and applied books on
                  computer graphics, computer vision, robotics, or
                  machine learning. This book covers the following
                  topics: affine geometry, projective geometry,
                  Euclidean geometry, convex sets, {SVD} and principal
                  component analysis, manifolds and Lie groups,
                  quadratic optimization, basics of differential
                  geometry, and a glimpse of computational geometry
                  {(Voronoi} diagrams and Delaunay
                  triangulations). Some practical applications of the
                  concepts presented in this book include computer
                  vision, more specifically contour grouping, motion
                  interpolation, and robot kinematics. In this
                  extensively updated second edition, more material on
                  convex sets, Farkas "s lemma, quadratic optimization
                  and the Schur complement have been added. The
                  chapter on {SVD} has been greatly expanded and now
                  includes a presentation of {PCA.} The book is well
                  illustrated and has chapter summaries and a large
                  number of exercises throughout. It will be of
                  interest to a wide audience including computer
                  scientists, mathematicians, and engineers. Reviews
                  of first {edition:"Gallier's} book will be a useful
                  source for anyone interested in applications of
                  geometrical methods to solve problems that arise in
                  various branches of engineering. It may help to
                  develop the sophisticated concepts from the more
                  advanced parts of geometry into useful tools for
                  applications." {(Mathematical} Reviews, 2001)"...it
                  will be useful as a reference book for postgraduates
                  wishing to find the connection between their current
                  problem and the underlying geometry." {(The}

  Abstract =     {We propose a variational procedure for the recovery
                  of internal variables, in effect extending them from
                  integration points to the entire domain. The
                  objective is to perform the recovery with minimum
                  error and at the same time guarantee that the
                  internal variables remain in their admissible
                  spaces. The minimization of the error is achieved by
                  a three-field finite element formulation. The fields
                  in the formulation are the deformation mapping, the
                  target or mapped internal variables and a Lagrange
                  multiplier that enforces the equality between the
                  source and target internal variables. This
                  formulation leads to an projection that minimizes
                  the distance between the source and target internal
                  variables as measured in the norm of the internal
                  variable space. To ensure that the target internal
                  variables remain in their original space, their
                  interpolation is performed by recourse to Lie
                  groups, which allows for direct polynomial
                  interpolation of the corresponding Lie algebras by
                  means of the logarithmic map. Once the Lie algebras
                  are interpolated, the mapped variables are recovered
                  by the exponential map, thus guaranteeing that they
                  remain in the appropriate space.},

                  rotation matrices at their specified knot times. In
                  our approach we regard SO(3) as a Lie group with a
                  bi-invariant Riemannian metric, and apply the
                  coordinate-invariant methods of Riemannian
                  geometry. The resulting rotation curve is easy to
                  compute, invariant with respect to fixed and moving
                  reference frames, and also approximately minimizes
                  angular acceleration.},

  Abstract =     {{The Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) series and the
                  Zassenhaus product are of fundamental importance for
                  the theory of Lie groups and their applications in
                  physics and physical chemistry. Standard methods for
                  the explicit construction of the BCH and Zassenhaus
                  terms yield polynomial representations, which must
                  be translated into the usually required commutator
                  representation. We prove that a new translation
                  proposed recently yields a correct representation of
                  the BCH and Zassenhaus terms. This representation
                  entails fewer terms than the well-known
                  Dynkin-Specht-Wever representation, which is of
                  relevance for practical applications. Furthermore,
                  various methods for the computation of the BCH and
                  Zassenhaus terms are compared, and a new efficient
                  approach for the calculation of the Zassenhaus terms
                  is proposed. Mathematica implementations for the
                  most efficient algorithms are provided together with
                  comparisons of efficiency. (C) 2009 Elsevier
